# First time using a Ghost theme?

Ghost uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.

Once you feel comfortable with how everything works, ghost also have full [theme API documentation](https://themes.ghost.org) which explains every possible Handlebars helper and template.

**The main files are:**

- `default.hbs` - The main template file
- `index.hbs` - Used for the home page
- `post.hbs` - Used for individual posts
- `page.hbs` - Used for individual pages
- `tag.hbs` - Used for tag archives
- `author.hbs` - Used for author archives

One really neat trick is that you can also create custom one-off templates just by adding the slug of a page to a template file. For example:

- `page-about.hbs` - Custom template for the `/about/` page
- `tag-news.hbs` - Custom template for `/tag/news/` archive
- `author-ali.hbs` - Custom template for `/author/ali/` archive


# Development

Wobble styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
$ yarn zip
```

# PostCSS Features Used

- Autoprefixer - Don't worry about writing browser prefixes of any kind, it's all done automatically with support for the latest 2 major versions of every browser.
- Variables - Simple pure CSS variables
- [Color Function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)


# SVG Icons

Wobble uses inline SVG icons, included via Handlebars partials. You can find all icons inside `/partials/icons`. To use an icon just include the name of the relevant file, eg. To include the SVG icon in `/partials/icons/rss.hbs` - use `{{> "icons/rss"}}`.

You can add your own SVG icons in the same manner.
